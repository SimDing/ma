This action is crucial for assessing the cart's update mechanism upon item deletion, ensuring the correct adjustment of item counts and total price.\": 1, \"Test the checkout process from an empty cart to identify how the website handles attempts to checkout with no items. This will determine the robustness and user guidance of the checkout process, important for preventing user confusion during an empty cart scenario. Additionally, it may reveal any error messages or instructions provided to the user in this scenario, which contributes to a better shopping experience.\": 1, \"Given the current scenario, with the checkout page accessible despite an empty cart, a new sub-goal is to test the website's handling of form submission from an empty cart state. This involves assessing the form's validation mechanisms against empty fields and the behavior of the system when attempting to process a transaction without any items in the cart. The objective is to uncover any potential weaknesses or areas for improvement in the website's form handling and transaction processing components.\": 1}."
