Additionally, there's a cart overlay that seems designed to show the cart's contents, but it's currently not visible.\",\"explanation\":\"To ensure comprehensive testing after facing an issue with the 'add to cart' button being obstructed in the 'Galaxy' section, it would be prudent to attempt adding a product from the 'S10' section to the cart.
