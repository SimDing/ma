2024-02-27 17:11:11.339022:Detailed coverage calculation explanation: Out of the total number of 98 blocks across all functions, 86 were covered (i.e., executed at least once during the test). This leads to a final coverage percentage of 87.75510204081633%. This percentage represents the ratio of the number of covered blocks to the total number of blocks, giving equal weight to each block.
