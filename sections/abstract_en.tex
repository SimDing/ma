\Abstract
Automating test processes is an important step towards improving software quality and minimizing errors. Automated tests can also save time and costs by allowing for quick and efficient identification and resolution of bugs. However, implementing tests based solely on a graphical user interface can often be time-consuming and expensive. Automated exploratory testing can be used to find conditions triggering crashes but can be very slow. Natural language designer tests can cover a broader category of tests, including functional tests and regression tests. They can either be executed manually by a tester, or specified as a script and executed using a tool such as Selenium. While such automated GUI tests are desirable, they still need to be programmed and maintained. 
To simplify this process, it would be advantageous to define tests in natural language and automatically execute them without human intervention. The goal of this thesis is to attempt this by using natural language test cases and a structured representation of the GUI as a prompt to a large language model (LLM) to decide which user action to simulate next.
